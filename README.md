# <Horiseon>

## Description

Horiseon is a mock website promoting it's own marketing buisness. It served the purpose of teaching refractory skills to an existing code. I learned how to create an accessible website, for example, by the use of alt tags. As well as, took away how to consolidate an HTML and CSS file while learning and understanding various semantic html elements.

## Credits

I worked with various study groups to brainstorm ideas on html and css pages. Specifically collaborated with Nicholas Golston with debugging each others projects as well as, assisted me with troubleshooting and projecting my project to GitHub. 

## Acceptance Criteria

```
WHEN I view the source code 
    - THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements 
    - THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements 
    - THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes 
    - THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element 
    - THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
